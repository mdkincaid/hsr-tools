# Laundry's HSR Tools

Using this project as a means to create tools I can use while learning React, Next.js, TailwindCSS and Mantine.

You can view the live site [here](https://hsr-tools.kincaid.dev). I will continue to work on this project and add to it as I learn more. I will also attempt to utilize GitHub Issues to keep track of things I want to work on and am working on.

  In some spheres the name I go by is "laundry" or "laundrymat", that is why these are "Laundry's HSR Tools"
