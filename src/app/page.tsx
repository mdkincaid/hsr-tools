      <p>Welcome to my site! This site serves multiple purposes.</p>
      <p>The first and primary purpose of this site is to help me learn React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Mantine and even some Vercel.</p>
      <p>The second purpose of this site is to act as a compilation of various tools and data tables created for use with the hit gacha game Honkai Star Rail from HoyoVerse.</p>
      <p>Majority of the tools and tables that will reside on this site are recreations of tools that were already made, by me, using google sheets.</p>
